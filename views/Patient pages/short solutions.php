                <p>
                    What is positive self-talk? Our internal dialogues, or
                    “self-talk,” can shape our beliefs and influence our
                    emotions and behavior, and provides assurance and
                    motivation. Positive self-talk is a healthy way to cope with
                    anxiety.

                <p>
                    There are different types of therapy options, such as group
                    therapy, family therapy, or individual therapy. Individual
                    therapy is characterized as a joint process between a mental
                    health professional and a person in therapy that many people
                    seek out to improve their wellbeing. Learn how what
                    therapeutic settings can help you feel your best.
